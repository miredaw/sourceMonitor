## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

Set these environment variables for production deployment:

```bash
export SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key-here"
export FLASK_ENV="production"
```

### Custom Port

To run on a different port, modify the last line in `app.py`:

```python
socketio.run(app, debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)  # Change port here
```

### Update Frequency

To change how often servers are queried, modify the sleep time in `app.py`:

```python
time.sleep(60)  # Update every 60 seconds instead of 30
```

## üîí Security Considerations

- The application stores server data in a local JSON file (`servers.json`)
- No authentication is built-in - consider adding authentication for production use
- Server queries are made from the backend, not exposing your monitoring setup
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration in production

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Server shows as offline but is actually online:**
- Check firewall settings on the game server
- Ensure the server is configured to respond to A2S queries
- Verify the correct IP address and port

**Application won't start:**
- Check that Python 3.7+ is installed
- Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly
- Verify port 4000 is available

**Players not showing:**
- Some servers may have player queries disabled
- Check server configuration for A2S settings

### Debug Mode

To enable debug logging, set the Flask environment:

```bash
export FLASK_ENV=development
```
